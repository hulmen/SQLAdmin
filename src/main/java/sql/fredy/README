Fredy's Admin Tool
------------------
Admin is a Tool around JDBC-enabled SQL-Databases to do basic jobs
for DB-Administrations, like:
- create/ drop tables
- create  indices
- perform sql-statements
- simple form
- a guided query
- Data Export
and a other usefull things in DB-arena

Structure
---------
Admin consists out of two parts:

1) The Admin Tool
2) Application Part


Admin Tool
----------
Admin is heavily based onto MetaData of a database. If these data are not available
or not complete, not all functions of Admin will work.

Admin is divided into these packages:

sql.fredy.admin	    the main Class of the Project

sql.fredy.share     a part containing classes needed by all 
                    packages. These are some classes hardly to sort different

sql.fredy.tools     contains the Logserver I wrote. SimpleLogServer
                    and all its related classes

sql.fredy.io	    contains all classes I need to handle IO-related questions

sql.fredy.sqltools  all the tools needed form DDL and DML

sql.fredy.metadata  these are the classes used to collect metadata information

sql.fredy.ui	    some user interface related classes

sql.fredy.generate  the classes I use to generate Java-Code



Prerequisits
------------
Minimum:
* java in version 8 and higher (http://openjdk.org)
* a JDBC-Driver for your RDBMS


Data Exporter:
DataExporter exports data into CSV, XML and XLS, if you want to
have XLS-files, you need to add POI to your CLASSPATH
* POI from http://jakarta.apache.org/poi

Code Generator
* JDOM minimum Beta 8 (http://www.jdom.org)
* CalendarBean.jar  (http://www.toedter.com/en/jcalendar/index.html)
  developed by Kai Toedter
* MSeries by Martin Newstead (http://web.ukonline.co.uk/mseries/downloads.html)


I put some of these JARS into the directory jars. Copyrights and license schemas
of theses jars apply.


Install
-------
1) Create your directory ADMIN_HOME and install all the files there. So there
   will be this structure:

ADMIN_HOME/sql/fredy/admin
                     datadrill
		     share
		     dbtools
                     generate
		     images
                     io
                     metadata
                     share
		     sqltools
		     tools
                     ui


ADMIN_HOME/applictions/basics

2) Add ADMIN_HOME and all the archives you need to your classpath

3) make sure, your PATH-Variable points to the right JDK/JRE min. 1.8


Starting Admin
--------------

 To run the project from the command line, go to the installed folder and
 type the following:

 java -jar "SqlAdmin.jar" 


   This launches Admin with the standard values. 
   Admin creates to property files:
   - admin.props            
   - adminlnf.props
     

   These files are stored by default in the users home directory.
   You can change this behaviour like this:
   change the user.home property of java:  

       java -Duser.home=MYDIRECTORY sql.fredy.admin.Admin

   or

       java -Dadmin.work=MYDIRECTORY sql.fredy.admin.Admin

   Environment Variables to control admin:

   Port of the internally used Derby DB is set per default to 60606, you can change it with the environment variable sql.fred.sqltool.derbyport
   The max. length of a column in the sql panel is set per default to 750, you can change it with the environment variable sql.fredy.sqltool.maxcolumnwidth

   These might be OS-environment or JVM environment variables


   Admin needs a number of icons to display. By default these
   icons are in ADMIN_HOME/sql/fredy/images.
   You can change this behaviour like this:
   
       java -Dadmin.image=MYIMAGEDIRECTORY sql.fredy.admin.Admin


   Admin searches in the file ADMIN_HOME/sql/fredy/share/rdbms.dat
   predefined connections. Probably your RDBMS is already there,
   if not, open this file with your preferred editor and add your RDBMS.
   If this does not work for any reason, add the parameter:

      -Dadmin.share=[directory where admin finds rdbms.dat]
  

   Please let me know it, so we can extend the list of the 'tested-with'.

within the property-files directory, there will be a created this structure:
user.home/sqladmin/autosave
                   work/SQLAdminworkDB

SQLMonitor
----------
The SQLMonitor stores every command sent to the DB within a Derby-DB  ( https://db.apache.org/derby)
You find this history by rightclicking within the SQLMonitor window. 
The DB is created in user.home/sqladmin/work and the name of the DB is SQLAdminworkDB. 
This internal DerbyServer is listening on port 60606

When you select 'quicksave' within the SQLMonitor, this files go to user.home/sqladmin/
and the content of the SQLMOnitor is regularly saved automatically every 15 minutes in the
autosave directory and the last 25 files are kept, per DB.

SQLMonitor can generate code out of a DB-Table or a query. It generates pieces of code, I use the
do JSF and swing development. 


Applications Part
-----------------
This you only need, if you intend to generate Java-Code out of Admin.
Admin has a function, that creates Java-Code out of a table. It does
the following classes for each table of a certain database:

a)the wrapper file:

The name of that class is Row.java .This code contains for each field 
in the table a get and a set methode. As well as there are insert, update, 
save and delete methods and searchBy{Fieldname}-methods.

As well as there is a searchAll-method. These searchXXX-methods are of type
xxxRow. All searchBy{FieldName}-mathods are as follows:

      public String searchBy(String,boolean)

Where String is the searchpattern and the boolean is to do a search as follows:
true = exact search (e.g. search * from table where field =
false= use wildcards (e.g. search * from table where field like

b)the Swing-GUI

The name of that class is Form.java. This is a simple swing-class delivering a gui, 
as you see it in the screenshots. You can launch this application equal you are 
launching admin. There is an example, where you see how I did it. It is basically:

      java -Duser.home={userhome} applications.{DB-Name}.{TableName}Formd -h host -u user -p password

c)the JTableModel

The name of this class is TableModel.java. IT allows to write back values to the DB as
they are changed, if the primarykey is known.


These files you best save into the directory ./java/applications. Admin then creates a 
directory named like the DB-name where it puts all these files into. See the documentation
codegenerator.pdf for further information.


History
-------
In the beginnings of Java I had my first look at this exiting product. 
So I decided to learn more about Java. As beeing a developer for data
-base-applications and generator in my former life it was a short 
decision to use a database related case for learning Java. 

So I started 1997 the development of a tool to manipulate mySQL-Datatabass.
As JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) supports a lot of functions around metadata, 
it was a good starting point for learning Java.

When Swing came out the GUI-capabilities of Java got much more functionalities. 
So I choosed Swing as the GUI-representation of my new tool.

The first steps with Java where pretty hard for a procedural software developper 
I was of about then years, but thanks to the help of some friends I got my first 
impression of how object oriented programming probably looks like and was able to 
implement the first function. To really get on speed I did not choose a 'Hello World'
thing, I directly jumped into the development of the 'Guided-Query'-class. 
While doing so, I had to learn how Java handels Meta-Data and how these layout-managers
works to create my first Swing-GUI.

While time was passing by, Admin got more and more functions and thanks to the 
JDBC-concept it was able to support other databases. 
Today I did some tests with mySQL, PostgreSQL, InstantDB, HypersonicSQL, Oracle and Empress. 

As the intention of the project is to learn about Java I put it under open-source. 
To publish this tool I became a member of the organization trash.net .

Admin is absolutely free for download and use.
Admin offers today the following functions:

    * Create Table
    * Create Index
    * Drop Table
    * Modify Table
    * Guided Query
    * SQL-Monitor
    * Dynamic online form
    * Generate Java Code out of a XML-File 
      (a Relational-Object-Wrapper and a Swing-Form and a JTableModel)
    * Meta-Data Info of a DB
    * DataExport intor various formats


All the windows are generated as panels, so they are able to run as standalone also
Such a tool is an ongoing project and probably I get some input from you.

Today Admin has been downloaded several thousand times and I got a lot of contacts 
to the internet-community from allover the world.

I'd be happy if you have a look at the product and to get some response and 
ideas to make the tool more powerfull.


Drop a file
-----------
Admin supports these filetypes to be dropped into its container:

- sql       --> this will open a sql monitor so you can work on the query
- txt       --> this will open a sql monitor so you can work on the query
- image     --> will put the image as a background of SQL admin
- Excelfile --> will import the excelfile into a db table provided by you
